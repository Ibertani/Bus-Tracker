# Bustracker
This project is to track one of six bus lines in boston that run between harvard and mit campuses. 
The data is live through MBTA and accessed using a async function. 
The marker updates to show the new position of the bus every 15 seconds.
An improvement in the future would be to show the bus route with a line that is generated as the bus moves and deleted when the bus turns around to do the route again.
